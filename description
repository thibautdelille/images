His mother, Polly Sutton, survived captivity during the1778 Battle of Wyoming, a harrowing episode of the Revolutionary War in whichsettlers were attacked by British forces and their Native allies. Her stories,along with the constant flow of trappers, hunters, and settlers passingthrough the region, deeply influenced Catlin’s understanding of the Americanwilderness and the people who called it home.</p><p>Though Catlin initially followed a traditional path, studying law atLitchfield Law School and practicing briefly in Philadelphia, his artisticpassion and desire to explore the West soon overpowered his legal career.Self-taught as an artist, Catlin found success as a miniaturist portraitist inPhiladelphia before embarking on a transformative journey westward in 1830.During this expedition, he met famed explorer William Clark (of Lewis andClark) in St. Louis, who provided Catlin with invaluable knowledge about theuncharted lands and their inhabitants.</p><p><strong>The North American Indian Portfolio: A Cultural Landmark</strong></p><p>Catlin’s North American Indian Portfolio was first published in 1844,featuring hand-colored lithographs based on his field sketches.
